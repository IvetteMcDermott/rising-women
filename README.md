# Project Overview
Rising Women is a platform developed by women for women in technology to help provide better access to training and development opportunities. The platform aims to encourage subject matter experts to support women in keeping up with new technologies, career empowerment and leadership development through mentorship. Women in technology, irrespective of their level of experience in the industry, are invited to join the community to share their skills and insights, to learn from their mentors, and to pass on their knowledge and strategies to succeed.

This platform was built using Django, Python, JavaScript and Bootstrap 4. The site was deployed on Heroku and uses Cloudinary for cloud storage.
